I recently started exploring **Julia**. It seems very intuitve and easy language, possibly because I am coming from **Python**. I didn't even had to leave my `IPython Notebook` environment to test drive Julia. Making Julia kernel available on my Anaconda Distribution of IPython was as simple as executing `Pkg.add("IJulia")` on the Julia prompt.
